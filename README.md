# Academic Research Summary: Blockchain Fundamentals

### Context
This is a summary of findings from a formal research project completed for the "Trends andFundamentals of Computer Science" course at Unisinos. The original academic paper (in Portuguese) is included in this repository.

I selected Blockchain as my research topic to explore its core technical principles beyond its applications in cryptocurrency.

### Key Concepts Researched
My research focused on analyzing the core components that define Blockchain technology:

* **Decentralization & Distributed Ledger:** Understanding how the network operates without a central authority and how all nodes maintain a copy of the ledger.
* **Immutability & Consensus:** Analyzing the cryptographic principles (like PoW/PoS) that make it "tamper-proof," meaning data, once recorded, cannot be altered.
* **Advanced R&D Topics (Post-Quantum Cryptography):** Investigated the threat of Quantum Computing to current cryptography (ECDSA/RSA) and the development of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) solutions like CRYSTALS-Dilithium.
* **Ecosystem Applications:** Explored the real-world impact of Smart Contracts, DeFi, NFTs, and Web3.

### Conclusion
This project solidified my understanding of Blockchain as a foundational technology for security and data integrity, with applications far beyond finance.
